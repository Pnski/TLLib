# LOOT DISTRIBUTION RULES
## General 11/5/24
Conquer devious Field Bosses, courageously explore Abyss Dungeons, and more in pursuit of Solisium’s greatest treasures. Before we dive into loot rules, you’ll first need to understand contributions and event items.

- Contribution: Contribution is earned by doing damage against the enemy and healing friendly players in battle while said enemy is active. Contribution from healing is acquired for healing players both in and out of your party when participating in guild-level events (Field Bosses).
- Event Items: Loot dropped during Dynamic Events that is collected to turn in for event progress. For example, wolf tails in the wolf hunting event.

Here’s an overview of loot distribution by activity.

## General Activities
- Open World Farming, Abyss Dungeon Farming, Quests, Contracts, Dynamic Events, Co-op Dungeons (excluding the final reward chest)
- Applicable Enemies: Normal, Elite, Party Elite

### Distribution Rules:
- When an enemy dies, loot is assigned to the player who first earned contribution (dealt damage in this case) to said enemy.
- If the player is in a group, the loot is assigned to the player’s party instead.
    - In this case, the drops from the enemy have equal chance of distribution across all party members.
        - The only exception is party members that have no contribution and are out of range will be excluded from the drop pool.
- All items are evenly distributed when possible. This means if there are 10 items dropped for a party of 5, each player should receive 2 items. If even distribution is not possible, it will randomly select a player(s) to receive an extra drop(s).
- Sollant and experience are distributed evenly.

## Peace Mode Bosses and Guild Raids
- Applicable enemies: Field Bosses and Arch Bosses

### Distribution Rules:
- When a Peace Mode Field Boss dies, all players are sorted by individual player contribution.
    - A guild’s overall contribution does not play a role for peace mode bosses and guild raids.
- Players must meet a minimum contribution to be eligible to receive loot from the boss.
- There are two drops types that come from Peace Mode Bosses:
    - Contribution drops: Each item is distributed based on chance according to individual contribution.
    - Random drops: Each Item is randomly provided only to remaining players who did not receive one of the contribution drops.
    - A single player is only eligible to receive one of these drops. In other words, a single player cannot receive more than 1 epic equipment item from a single boss encounter.
- Sollant and experience are distributed evenly.

Example:

Lets assume that a Field Boss drops the following loot when defeated:

- Contribution Drops: 1x Sword, 1x Mask, 1000 Sollant
- Random Drops: 1x Boots
Assuming you’ve met the minimum contribution requirement described above, if your contribution was 3% of the total contribution, you would have a 3% chance of acquiring either the sword or the mask. All players that met the minimum contribution requirement would have an equal chance to acquire the Boots, regardless of total contribution. Any player who receives epic equipment is unable to attain a second piece of epic equipment from the same boss kill.

## Conflict Mode Bosses
- Applicable enemies: Field Bosses and Arch Bosses

### Distribution Rules:
- Loot is assigned in a two stage process. First, loot is assigned to a guild. Then, the loot is assigned to players within the guild.
- When a Field Boss dies during conflict mode, a Guild’s contribution is calculated as the sum of the individual contribution for each player in the guild who participated in the fight.
- The guilds are then sorted based on contribution.
- Guilds must meet a minimum contribution to be eligible to receive loot from the boss.
- Loot items are distributed based on chance according to Guild contribution.
    - Note: Unlike peace mode bosses, dying to an enemy or another player during a conflict mode boss will result in the dying player losing 70% of their individual contribution — meaning it reduces the guild’s total contribution at the end of the match.
    - Once a guild has been assigned an item, all participating players within the guild have equal chance to obtain the item.
- Sollant and experience are distributed evenly.

Example:

Lets assume that a Field Boss drops the following loot when defeated:

- Drops: 1x Sword, 1x Mask, 1000 Sollant
If players A, B, and C had 10%, 15%, and 20% contribution respectively and all belonged to the same guild, then the guild’s total contribution would be 45%. That means this guild would have a 45% chance to acquire the Sword and Mask. If the guild successfully acquired the Mask, then players A, B, and C would each have an equal chance to receive the Mask.
