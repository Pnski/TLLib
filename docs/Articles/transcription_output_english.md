 Long, long ago, the elves gifted language and magic to humanity. However, mankind began to dabble in magic that was forbidden, and war broke out between the two peoples. Driven back and put on the defensive, the human wizards crystallized the resentment and despair of their dead. This forbidden weapon of war was called the abyssal meteor. It was scion tegaroth, a wizard of the Lightbringer Society, who brought the war to an end. He established precepts of magic, and split the abyssal meteor into seven pieces, sealing them in various locations around the world. As time passed, part of the ocean floor into Laundry rose, revealing a buried fragment of the meteor. From the meteor poured a red fog that caused the vegetation in the swamp to mutate.

 Artym forces captured Martinet, the younger of two twin sisters. By keeping her hostage, they forced the shaman Adriana, who wielded the power of a star fragment to core forth the reigns. As the ritual began, rain cascaded from the sky, accompanied by crashes of thunder. But the Artym forces had altered the ritual. Their tampering caused a cursed reign to fall on Lasslin. Wherever the rain fell, creatures transformed into violent monsters that attacked people and devastated the farmland. Adriana was shocked to witness what she had done. And the Artym forces turned on the sisters, meaning to kill them now that they had served their purpose. The awe-inspiring power of the star fragment that laid dormant with an Adriana flooded out and their enemies were annihilated in an instant. In the aftermath, Adriana was beset by unspeakable disfigurations, swallowed by guilt over her role in causing the cursed reign.

 Vernon, the Lord of Stone God, who colluded with Archium, exploited the inhabitants and ruled over them with an iron fist. The resistance raided and seized the Vernon Archium's armies cargo and distributed it among the people. One day, an extraordinary girl and two dwarves came to visit Vernon. The girl said that if she received funding, she would use it to find a legendary stone called the Heart of the Ancient Golem, build a giant golem and subdue the resistance. Though originally filled with doubt, Vernon ended up giving her a substantial sum after watching her golem's performance. The girl's company unraveled the secret of the monolithic boulder. Along the way, a rock struck Henderson and rendered him unconscious. Although they were chased by Chernabog and braved many perilous adventures, in the end, they acquired the stone. After completing the giant golem, the girl made Vernon dance in a huge chest and chant a spell, explaining that it was a ritual that would bind him to the golem, making him its owner. Vernon emerged from the chest and the giant golem broke down the gate. All at once, the resistance flooded in and captured the castle. The girl was revealed to be Sienna Parsons, a resistance member and genius engineer. Even now, when you visit the enter village, you can still hear tales of her adventures sung by Sienna's comrade in arms, Henderson-Harmon.

 Hamil, the sacred deer of the Black Owl Plains, met his demise, and his death heralded Iscale's return. Those who fled from the wolves found themselves isolated in the Abbey. Iscale, with the power of the star fragment and backed by a pack of ravenous wolves set upon them. While the people cowered in terror, Henry rose to the occasion. He had always admired Hamil's courage, and he took heart from it now, urging the others to escape. As Henry desperately battled against the wolves, Iscale rushed towards him. Henry knew of Iscale's weak point. Hamil had come to him in a dream, showing him what he needed to know, and so Henry hurled his torch at the bottles of lamp oil in the storeroom. The oil ignited instantly, and with each fire explosion the very ground beneath their feet trembled. Henry was caught in the flames, along with Iscale. All that remained when the others returned to the Abbey were the bones and ashes of Henry and the wolves. Now the people of Castleton hold a wolf hunting contest every year to honor the courage and sacrifice of the young hero.

 The Crimson Family was a professional assassin clan who secretly cooperated with Archium. They secretly performed countless terrible experiments, all in the name of perfecting their deadly art. The elder son of the Crimson Family, Lazarus, and the daughter of Burkhat family, Norn, she quickly met at the quiet bell tower and fostered death a bit in love. After learning that Norn was sacrificed in an experiment in the Crimson's basement, Lazarus released all the trapped abominations and turned the mansion into a living hell. Azar appeared in front of the dying Lazarus, offering him immortality and power. Lazarus accepted, turning it to a wraith who wields a giant sword. Norn survived the experimentation at the expense of her own humanity. An hour monster, she was hidden away and soon gave birth to her son, Remy. Recently in Urber Village, people have been claiming that they've seen the couple's ghosts near the bell tower.

 The Star of Siloveth. It is said to be the Sealstone containing Siloveth, goddess of destruction. This magical star of destruction was shattered into pieces all across the world, and those who were born with this fragment were called the Star Children. In 1192, during an age of conflict, the Archim commander Kazar sought to use the power of the star fragments as a tool of war. The wizard Jan Junath sent Calanthea, a witch, to the remote island where star children were hiding.

 The Phonos, a warrior clan, and the Calteran, a hunter clan, both followed the same chieftain. However, when shaman Akidu became the chieftain due to his remarkable talent with dark magic, some orcs protested, claiming he succeeded in the election ritual by using unfair tactics. Akidu responded by creating his own clan by transforming his own kind into vicious shadow orcs, but couldn't expand his power due to the limits of dark magic. In a later age, Kazah, of the Archium Legion, approached Tuarun, the latest chief of the Archidu clan. He demanded a legion of shadow orcs, in return for the endless power of a star fragment. Tuarun accepted, to this day, he continues to create new shadow orcs to terrorize the world.

 One stormy night. Six shadow-mancers gathered atop a tower. Envious of Juneabote's demonic covenant, they summoned their own demon. Risaeth offered sweet words and whispered promises. They killed each other to win her favor. In the end, the last shadow-mancer standing became a monster, unable to control her power. This attracted the attention of Havre's. As holder of Juneabote's covenant, he attacked Risaeth to ensure control of all the star fragments in the mortal realm. Severely wounded, Havre's fled, disguising himself as a human. Risaeth then proceeded with her master plan. To resurrect the demon goddess Silaveth, now possessing the body of Vennelux wizard-a-layer, Risaeth has begun the hunt for star fragments.

 Hamil, the sacred deer of the Black Owl Plains, met his demise. And his death heralded Iscale's return. Those who fled from the wolves found themselves isolated in the abbey. Iscale with the power of the star fragment and backed by a pack of ravenous wolves set upon them. While the people cowered in terror Henry rose to the occasion, he had always admired Hamil's courage and he took heart from it now, urging the others to escape. As Henry desperately battled against the wolves, Iscale rushed towards him. Henry knew of Iscale's weak point. Hamil had come to him in a dream, showing him what he needed to know. And so Henry hurled his torch at the bottles of lamp oil in the storeroom. The oil ignited instantly and with each fiery explosion the very ground beneath their feet trembled. Henry was caught in the flames along with Iscale. All that remained when the others returned to the abbey were the bones and ashes of Henry in the wolves. Now the people of Castleton hold a wolf hunting contest every year to honor the courage and sacrifice of the young hero.

 While being bitten by a vampire, Ezekiel was saved by Scarla the monster hunter. Despite now becoming a half vampire, Scarla trained him to become a vampire hunter. Scarla would later be killed by Baron Leonidas, a powerful vampire lord. Ezekiel vowed to avenge her. Over the course of decades, Ezekiel became a legendary vampire slayer. He found Leonidas and began a fight to the death. But Leonidas was too strong. At death's door, Ezekiel used the last of his strength to draw a magic circle with blood and placed a guardian's pledge in its center. With his soul now infused in the pledge, Ezekiel became a guardian, protecting others from vampires.

 Ten years ago, craftsmen in the employ of the Archim Legion secretly visited the resistance soldiers at the observatory, offering a huge reward for aid in stealing gems from the goblins. The soldiers, who were suffering through a famine, were overwhelmed with temptation. All but three of them left the camp. While the guards were away, the waiting Archim battled Platoon, ready for the attack. Watch Captain Henson understood the situation all too well. He told the three remaining guards to flee, and one of them, Ruffalo, escaped into the woods with his head hung low. Battling against an endless sea of enemies, the two remaining guards died horrible deaths. Henson, who lost an eye, rose again each time he fell, sword held high. Just as Henson gravely wounded, neared his own death. Ruffalo returned. He had not fled at all, but instead brought reinforcements who drove back the enemy forces. Although the bravery of Henson and his men saved many lives, he blamed himself for the death of the soldiers and resigned as watch Captain. Ten years later, he still quietly defends the front lines and is admired and respected by the local resistance forces.

 As Revolupius' army swept across Lasslin, Sophia and Rutain, siblings whose parents had died in the war fled for their lives and lost their way in the Spider Forest. Their childhood friend Rob searched for them, at Lass discovering them hanging in a spider web deep in a cave. The three children struggled to undo the webs, but in the end, they were all captured by the owner of the cave Morokai, who meant to feed them to his spiders. At the very moment they thought it was all over, they heard the clash of weapons outside the cave. Rutain's hero, Captain Da Vinci, had been tracking Morokai when he found the trail left by the children. Backed by resistant soldiers, he rushed to the rescue. The hand that reached out to them in that time of despair planted dreams of heroism in the children's minds, and they resolved to become just like Da Vinci, aiding those in need. Ten years later, the strong and ambitious warrior Sophia, the charming and agile hunter Robert and the gentle and kind wizard Rutain became known as the terrific trio of the resistance.

 While being bitten by a vampire, Ezekiel was saved by Skala the monster hunter. Despite now becoming a half vampire, Skala trained him to become a vampire hunter. Skala would later be killed by Baron Leonidas, a powerful vampire lord. Ezekiel vowed to avenge her. Over the course of decades, Ezekiel became a legendary vampire slayer. She found Leonidas and began a fight to the death. But Leonidas was too strong. At death's door, Ezekiel used the last of his strength to draw a magic circle with blood and placed a guardian's pledge in its center.

 Archium forces captured Martinet the younger of two twin sisters. By keeping her hostage, they forced the shaman Adriana, who wielded the power of a star fragment to core forth the rains. As the ritual began, rain cascaded from the sky, accompanied by crashes of thunder. But the Archium forces had altered the ritual. Their tampering caused a cursed rain to fall on Lasslan. Wherever the rain fell, creatures transformed into violent monsters that attacked people and devastated the farmland. Adriana was shocked to witness what she had done. When the Archium forces turned on the sisters, meaning to kill them now that they had served their purpose. The awe-inspiring power of a star fragment that laid dormant with an Adriana flooded out and their enemies were annihilated in an instant. In the aftermath, Adriana was beset by unspeakable disfigurations, swallowed by guilt over her role in causing the cursed rain.

 One stormy night. Six shadow-mancers gathered atop a tower. Envious of Juneabote's demonic covenant, they summoned their own demon. Risaith offered sweet words and whispered promises. They killed each other to win her favor. In the end, the last shadow-mancer standing became a monster, unable to control her power. This attracted the attention of Havrez. As holder of Juneabote's covenant, he attacked Risaith to ensure control of all the star fragments in the mortal realm. Severely wounded, Havrez fled, disguising himself as a human. Risaith then proceeded with her master plan. To resurrect the demon goddess Silaveth, now possessing the body of Venneluk's wizard and the lair, Risaith has begun the hunt for star fragments.

 Ten years ago, craftsmen in the arm-ploy of the Archim Legion secretly visited the resistance soldiers at the observatory, offering a huge reward for aid in stealing gems from the goblins. The soldiers, who were suffering through a famine, were overwhelmed with temptation. All but three of them left the camp. While the guards were away, the waiting Archim battle platoon, readied for the attack. Watch Captain Henson understood the situation all too well. He told the three remaining guards to flee, and one of them, Ruffalo, escaped into the woods with his head hung low. Battling against an endless sea of enemies, the two remaining guards died horrible deaths. Henson, who lost an eye, rose again each time he fell, sword held high. Just as Henson gravely wounded, neared his own death. Ruffalo returned, he had not fled at all, but instead brought reinforcements who drove back the enemy forces. Although the bravery of Henson and his men saved many lives, he blamed himself for the death of the soldiers, and resigned as watch Captain. Ten years later, he still quietly defends the front lines, and is admired and respected by the local resistance forces.

 after losing his eldest son in a dispute over rights with the Burkhand family. Paquilunaru, the commander of the Black Anvil Legion, cut off all trade with the outside world and started killing humans. In need of obsidian, a rare mineral from the Black Anvil region, the Archim Legion visited Bonia Naru, Paquilunaru, who had succeeded him as ruler.

 After his defeat in an ancient tribal war, the giant Quietus had his heart taken and sealed away by the elves. The light bringer society succeeded the elves as the protectors of Quietus' heart. Then one day, dark mances raided the place where the heart was sealed, and deluge Noah used the power of the heart to stop them. But the power was too great, and she was transformed into a frenzied elemental spirit. Helverpheus, the sole survivor, returned later, with a group of wizards and sealed her away. A hundred years passed, and then Kazar noticed the power hidden in that place. He sent the Archim Legion to break the seal.

 The Phonos, a warrior clan, and the Calteran, a hunter clan, both followed the same chieftain. However, when shaman Akidu became the chieftain due to his remarkable talent with dark magic, some orcs protested, claiming he succeeded in the election ritual by using unfair tactics. He was due to his own clan by transforming his own kind into vicious shadow orcs, but couldn't expand his power due to the limits of dark magic. In a later age, Kazar, of the Archium Legion, approached Tuarun, the latest chief of the Akidu clan. He demanded a legion of shadow orcs, in return for the endless power of a star fragment. Tuarun accepted to this day he continues to create new shadow orcs to terrorize the world.

Enter the Order of the Swan, a small time guild, hired by the Resistance to help gather sandworm poison sacks. While the Resistance soldiers were mopping up the sandworms, they were suddenly dragged into the sand beneath their feet. One of the swans, Rowan, fell into the vortex. All at once, Queen Belandia reared up, writhing in pain. Rowan had morphed into a violet phoenix and burst free from Queen Belandia's carapace, freeing everyone trapped inside. To this day, the mere sight of a human touched with more Vessence is enough to violate the Enrage of the Mighty Beast.

 As Revolupius' army swept across Lasslin, Sophia and Rutain, siblings whose parents had died in the war, fled for their lives, and lost their way in the Spider Forest. Their childhood friend Rob searched for them, at last discovering them hanging in a spider web, deep in a cave. The three children struggled to undo the webs, but in the end they were all captured by the owner of the cave Morachi, who meant to feed them to his spiders. At the very moment they thought it was all over, they heard the clash of weapons outside the cave. Rutain's hero, Captain Da Vinci, had been tracking Morachi when he found the trail left by the children. Back by resistant soldiers, he rushed to the rescue. The hand that reached out to them in that time of despair, planted dreams of heroism in the children's minds, and they resolved to become just like Da Vinci, aiding those in need. Ten years later, the strong and ambitious warrior Sophia, the charming and agile hunter Robert, and the gentle and kind wizard Rutain became known as the terrific trio of the resistance.
