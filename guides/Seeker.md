# Seeker PvE Guide

This shall be a general overview for a PvE Seeker. After reading thsi guide you should have the necessary knowledge to build around your team, keep them alive and provide usefull buffs.

Seeker (Wand/Longbow) excells at providing damagebuffs (janice rage, archer's surge, valorous barrier), healing (flash wave, healing touch, swift healing, fountain of life) and preventing damage (invincible wall).

## Stats

First of all depending on how you heal you have different options. For this guide i recommend healing via healing touch, flash wave and fountain of life.

While they all benefit for your max damagevalue, healing over time (hot) gains alot via min damage and your buffduration.

i recommend:

| stat | points |
| --- | --- |
| str | 50 |
| dex | rest |
| wis | 99 |
| per | 99 |
| for | 11 |

This should provide seeker with a good survibility, short cooldowns, and long buffdurations with enough damage to heal a good amount.
